# Wall-Openings
A tool to efficiently sketch sections of walls with openings, with the ability to differentiate between existing and requested openings.

Often throughout the construction phase of a facility, new openings are required in existing walls. In order to perform structural analysis of the wall and to determine if the new opening can be implemented, structural engineers must see the orientation of the opening in relation to existing ones. Sketching this in AutoCAD is simple but tedious and error-prone. This tool expidites the process and eliminates room for human error.
